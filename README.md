# HIT THE GRID

Hit the Grid is a simple image grid tool. Very simple, that is. It features minimal grid customizations. Works good enough on mobile.

## What is it lacking for a modern tool?

This is not a fully fledged tool, and there is no plans, thus far, to improve it. Images that are uploaded are staying locally in your browser, by the way.
- Your image cannot be edited: no cropping, no effects, etc. Cropping your image before loading is advised.  
- The image with the grid overlay cannot be saved by any means other than screen captures which may limit the quality to your device's screen resolution. As far as I know. 

## Why is it made?

I can't find a proper grid tool to grid my images for drawing portraits. Fine, I'll do it myself. Of course, this isn't a fully fledged tool, but it works for me.  

Perhaps I have just missed the good ones. Not that I know of.  

## How is it made?

Everything is made with plain HTML, CSS, & good ol' vanilla Javascript.

## Why "Hit the Grid" ?

I named it on a whim. Perhaps you have a better one?

## Final thoughts

None. Happy gridding.
